In python, seek() and tell() functions are used to work
with file objects and their positions
within a file. These functions are part of the built in io modules
which provides a consistent interface for reading and writing to various files 
like objects, such as files, pipes and in-memory buffers.

so now as i am doing a sort of coding and gradually increasing effort
to make my day 1 percent better than yesterday today i found i actually type by looking in the screen as i have built that strength 
although i am making small spelling mistaked but i found i actually can do it 
so impressing for me because there is something i am acheiving 
despite i have wasted many times but little acheivements is encouraging me to do better things 
so what do you think of building a new habit 
so i gradually feel something new 
and something grand and some cozy too 
as i am developing in my way 
hip hip hurray python is my buddy 
and data sceince is my dream and i am stepping one step toward my dream 
huhuhuhuhu
